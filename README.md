# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
In this study I have taken a dataset which consists of Students marks in Machine Learning and Python. There were certain missing values in the data which handled by using the Simple imputer method from the sklearn library. I divided the data into X and Y where X consisted of The BackGround of the student , and their marks in Machine Learning and Python. Y consists of Remark ie. whether a student has passed or failed. I used One Hot Encoding to Encode the Background of the students and used Label Encoding for the Remarks collumn. I split the data into training data and testing data and performed feature scaling using standard Scaler
